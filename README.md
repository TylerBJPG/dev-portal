Development Portfolio

This is simply a repo to track all updates and changes made to my live Development Portfolio over at development.tylerbjpg.com

Everything is publicly available to clone and fiddle with if that's what you're into; this is primarily here so that I can teach myself version control while I work across my
iPad, Laptop and Workstation learning all there is to know about the web space.
